#KivyAppGps1
This app is to teach me how to move around plyer obejects. I want to get the longitude and latitude to display on the interface of the application. This will only work on a device that has GPS.

My other repo KivyApp1 is the same framework and works on a desktop computer but it has no GPS. I am using that one to help someone that might understand OOP better than me but may not be as familiar with Kivy.
